        <h2>The Evolution of Web Technology</h2>
        <h3><em>Static Languages and the Future of the Web</em></h3>
        <p>Posted on <strong>August 31, 2015</strong> by <strong>Nick Pizzo</strong></p>
        <p>Much has been written on the topic of the future of the internet, and
          the changing nature of the typical interaction with web content. On many timelines, the
          surrounding and practices surrounding this regular part of life are still in their
          infancy, and one has to marvel at how quickly interacting with the internet has become
          a regular part of the human experience. Just like any exploding industry with a diverse
          and global market, many smart minds are working hard on furthering ease of web adoption.
          <br></br>
          An trend that may become more common is native browser support for techniques that now
          require external libraries. As mobile internet access continues to grow, responsive applications
          will be embraced and developers will have an easier experience implementing these techniques.
          HTML standards will catch up to the consensus of developer practices as this is perhaps the best
          feedback loop for the evolution of development.
          <br></br>
          Going forward, the user experience will be ever more removed from the inner-workings of the
          very tools used to access the internet. A larger number of home and office fixtures now
          have the ability to go online. This allows for collaboration among many points of connectivity,
          allowing user interaction to become more centralized and feature-rich.
          <br></br>
          Taking a look even further into the future is even more interesting. There is enough evidence
          to accurately say that hardware size will continue to decrease as micro computing becomes
          standardized. Interaction with software will resemble reality more and more, and personalied
          mobile virtual experiences will likely become common. As it has for several decades, web
          technology will offer a means of archiving human collaborative expression that enlightens and
          empowers the individual. The implications of this will continue to be realized, and they all
          offer a peek into vast worlds previously unimanginable. It's a great time to be a part of
          web technology.
